## VM Hardware Requirements
8GB of RAM, 60GB of Disk space and an Internet Connection.


## VMware Workstation or Fusion for mac

Download and Install Workstation on any of the supported platforms:-
* Windows
* Ubuntu
* MacOs(Fusion)

You need to have some basic knowledge of networking in VMware Workstation using [Network Editor ](https://pubs.vmware.com/workstation-11/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.vmware.ws.using.doc%2FGUID-D9B0A52D-38A2-45D7-A9EB-987ACE77F93C.html).
**You might need a License for VMware Workstation or Fusion for mac.**


## A Recommended Terminal Utility
It will be good you have a multi-terminal utility such as [hyper.is](https://hyper.is/) which I have used.


[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) can be used to run commands on multiple compute instances at the same time. Labs in this tutorial may require running the same commands across multiple compute instances, in those cases consider using tmux and splitting a window into multiple panes with synchronize-panes enabled to speed up the provisioning process.

> The use of tmux is optional and not required to complete this tutorial.
