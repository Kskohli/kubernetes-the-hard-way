# Provisioning Compute Resources

Kubernetes requires a set of machines to host the Kubernetes control plane and the worker nodes where containers are ultimately run. In this lab you will provision the compute resources required for running a secure Kubernetes cluster on VMware Workstation.

Created 3 VMs for this simple deployment.
</br> VM1 named master001, CPU-2, MEMORY-2GB, HDD-20GB, NETWORK-NAT
</br> VM2 named worker001  CPU-1, MEMORY-1GB, HDD-20GB, NETWORK-NAT
</br> VM3 named worker002  CPU-1, MEMORY-1GB, HDD-20GB, NETWORK-NAT

I choose NAT(Network Address Translation) so that I can use Internet on Ubuntu Virtual Machines as well as I connect to them using SSH from the same machine where workstation is installed.


## VM Operating System Requirements

[Download](http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/ubuntu-16.04.6-server-amd64.iso) the ISO for Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS.
</br>Create it with above mentioned configuration & Install the OS with following settings:-
* You need to disable any updates from CD as we will be using internet to update & upgrade the packages.
```
nano /etc/apt/sources.list  
```
and comment(#) on line number 1. Where cdrom is mentioned.

* It needs SWAP to be disabled for which is better explained by [@FrankDenneman in his post](https://frankdenneman.nl/2018/11/15/kubernetes-swap-and-the-vmware-balloon-driver/).
You can check the status of Swap File/Partition in OS by running **free -h** command and disable post that.

```
swapoff -a

vim /etc/fstab  
```
and comment(#) on line number 10, where swapfile/swap partition/swap word is mentioned. 

* After this we need static IP for Our Machines, it could be done at the time of installation or could be done by editing a file:-
It has to be performed on VM1 **master001**

```
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto ens33
iface ens33 inet static
        address 182.20.10.200
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 182.20.10.0
        broadcast 182.20.10.255
        gateway 182.20.10.2
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
```


It has to be performed on VM2 **worker001**

```
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

# The loopback network interface

        netmask 255.255.255.0
        network 182.20.10.0
        broadcast 182.20.10.255
        gateway 182.20.10.2
        # dns-* options are implemented by the resolvconf package, if installed
        dns-nameservers 8.8.8.8
```
It has to be performed on VM3 **worker002**

```
sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
# This file describes the network interfaces available on your system
# and how to activate them. For more information, see interfaces(5).

source /etc/network/interfaces.d/*

## Networking


### Virtual Private Cloud Network

In this section a dedicated [Virtual Private Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networks-and-firewalls#networks) (VPC) network will be setup to host the Kubernetes cluster.

Create the `kubernetes-the-hard-way` custom VPC network:

```
gcloud compute networks create kubernetes-the-hard-way --subnet-mode custom
```

A [subnet](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/vpc/#vpc_networks_and_subnets) must be provisioned with an IP address range large enough to assign a private IP address to each node in the Kubernetes cluster.

Create the `kubernetes` subnet in the `kubernetes-the-hard-way` VPC network:

```
gcloud compute networks subnets create kubernetes \
  --network kubernetes-the-hard-way \
  --range 10.240.0.0/24
```

> The `10.240.0.0/24` IP address range can host up to 254 compute instances.

### Firewall Rules

Create a firewall rule that allows internal communication across all protocols:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-internal \
  --allow tcp,udp,icmp \
  --network kubernetes-the-hard-way \
  --source-ranges 10.240.0.0/24,10.200.0.0/16
```

Create a firewall rule that allows external SSH, ICMP, and HTTPS:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules create kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-external \
  --allow tcp:22,tcp:6443,icmp \
  --network kubernetes-the-hard-way \
  --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0
```

> An [external load balancer](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/load-balancing/network/) will be used to expose the Kubernetes API Servers to remote clients.

List the firewall rules in the `kubernetes-the-hard-way` VPC network:

```
gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter="network:kubernetes-the-hard-way"
```

> output

```
NAME                                    NETWORK                  DIRECTION  PRIORITY  ALLOW                 DENY
kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-external  kubernetes-the-hard-way  INGRESS    1000      tcp:22,tcp:6443,icmp
kubernetes-the-hard-way-allow-internal  kubernetes-the-hard-way  INGRESS    1000      tcp,udp,icmp
```

### Kubernetes Public IP Address

Allocate a static IP address that will be attached to the external load balancer fronting the Kubernetes API Servers:

```
gcloud compute addresses create kubernetes-the-hard-way \
  --region $(gcloud config get-value compute/region)
```

Verify the `kubernetes-the-hard-way` static IP address was created in your default compute region:

```
gcloud compute addresses list --filter="name=('kubernetes-the-hard-way')"
```

> output

```
NAME                     REGION    ADDRESS        STATUS
kubernetes-the-hard-way  us-west1  XX.XXX.XXX.XX  RESERVED
```

## Compute Instances

The compute instances in this lab will be provisioned using [Ubuntu Server](https://www.ubuntu.com/server) 18.04, which has good support for the [containerd container runtime](https://github.com/containerd/containerd). Each compute instance will be provisioned with a fixed private IP address to simplify the Kubernetes bootstrapping process.

### Kubernetes Controllers

Create three compute instances which will host the Kubernetes control plane:

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  gcloud compute instances create controller-${i} \
    --async \
    --boot-disk-size 200GB \
    --can-ip-forward \
    --image-family ubuntu-1804-lts \
    --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud \
    --machine-type n1-standard-1 \
    --private-network-ip 10.240.0.1${i} \
    --scopes compute-rw,storage-ro,service-management,service-control,logging-write,monitoring \
    --subnet kubernetes \
    --tags kubernetes-the-hard-way,controller
done
```

### Kubernetes Workers

Each worker instance requires a pod subnet allocation from the Kubernetes cluster CIDR range. The pod subnet allocation will be used to configure container networking in a later exercise. The `pod-cidr` instance metadata will be used to expose pod subnet allocations to compute instances at runtime.

> The Kubernetes cluster CIDR range is defined by the Controller Manager's `--cluster-cidr` flag. In this tutorial the cluster CIDR range will be set to `10.200.0.0/16`, which supports 254 subnets.

Create three compute instances which will host the Kubernetes worker nodes:

```
for i in 0 1 2; do
  gcloud compute instances create worker-${i} \
    --async \
    --boot-disk-size 200GB \
    --can-ip-forward \
    --image-family ubuntu-1804-lts \
    --image-project ubuntu-os-cloud \
    --machine-type n1-standard-1 \
    --metadata pod-cidr=10.200.${i}.0/24 \
    --private-network-ip 10.240.0.2${i} \
    --scopes compute-rw,storage-ro,service-management,service-control,logging-write,monitoring \
    --subnet kubernetes \
    --tags kubernetes-the-hard-way,worker
done
```

### Verification

List the compute instances in your default compute zone:

```
gcloud compute instances list
```

> output

```
NAME           INTERNAL_IP     
master001
worker001      10.240.0.20  
worker002      10.240.0.21   
```

## Configuring SSH Access

SSH will be used to configure the controller and worker instances. When connecting to compute instances for the first time SSH keys will be generated for you and stored in the project or instance metadata as described in the [connecting to instances](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-instance) documentation.

Test SSH access to the `controller-0` compute instances:

```
gcloud compute ssh controller-0
```

If this is your first time connecting to a compute instance SSH keys will be generated for you. Enter a passphrase at the prompt to continue:

```
WARNING: The public SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
WARNING: The private SSH key file for gcloud does not exist.
WARNING: You do not have an SSH key for gcloud.
WARNING: SSH keygen will be executed to generate a key.
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```

At this point the generated SSH keys will be uploaded and stored in your project:

```
Your identification has been saved in /home/$USER/.ssh/google_compute_engine.
Your public key has been saved in /home/$USER/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:nz1i8jHmgQuGt+WscqP5SeIaSy5wyIJeL71MuV+QruE $USER@$HOSTNAME
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+

```

After the SSH keys have been updated you'll be logged into the `controller-0` instance:

```
Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-1042-gcp x86_64)
...

Last login: Sun Sept 14 14:34:27 2019 from XX.XXX.XXX.XX
```

Type `exit` at the prompt to exit the `controller-0` compute instance:

```
$USER@controller-0:~$ exit
```
> output

```
logout
Connection to XX.XXX.XXX.XXX closed
```
